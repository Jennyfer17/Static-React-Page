This is the first webpage that I created using React with Webpack. 
It is a challenge made by Scrimba, an organization that offers online courses related to programming and stuffs like that.

PS: I had to configure webpack manually, I could not use create-react-app. It was a challenge I made to myselft but I'm not going to do it again, it's hella complicated.
